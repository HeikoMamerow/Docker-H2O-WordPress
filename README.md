# Docker-H2O-WordPress
Running WordPress with MariaDB and PHP on H2O webserver in Docker. You can use this for local development also for running on live server. But at the moment it is not so safe for production, because you have to secure the database passwords! 

## Updates:
- 28.12.18: Create repository on GiHhub and fill with first stuff. This version comes still without WordPress. This comes with the next update.
